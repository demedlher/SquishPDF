# Ideas & Feature Requests

## Under Consideration
- [ ] **Commercial fork** - Fork the project to use non-AGPL PDF libraries (e.g., PDFKit, Quartz) to enable distribution on Gumroad or Apple App Store
- [ ] **Evaluate alternative PDF libraries** - Compare Ghostscript with native macOS frameworks (PDFKit, Quartz) or other libraries for compression quality and speed (use benchmark.sh to track)

## Maybe Later

- [ ] **Preset customization** - Allow users to define custom DPI/quality settings
- [ ] **Output location preference** - Option to save compressed files to a different folder
- [ ] **Drag-out support** - Allow dragging the compressed file out of the app after conversion
- [ ] **Menu bar mode** - Lightweight menu bar app for quick compression

## Completed

- [x] **Batch processing** - Drop multiple PDFs and/or select multiple presets to process in one go (v3.1)
- [x] **Clickable output path** - Success message is now clickable to reveal the converted file in Finder (v2.10)
